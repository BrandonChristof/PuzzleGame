# PuzzleGame
A simple puzzle game where the goal is to manipulate 4 squares to the exit by sliding them up/down/left/right. The catch is that they must all exit at the same time.

## Example of a puzzle:

**Sliding RIGHT will give:**

And finally, sliding RIGHT will cause all squares to exit all at once:

This is the optimal solution for solving this puzzle (few moves as possible). However, the difficulty increases as the optimal solutions become higher and higher.
